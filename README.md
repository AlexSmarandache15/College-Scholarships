Introduction
 <br /> <br />
In our faculty, there are, in principle, 3 types of scholarships: excellence, merit and social assistance.
 <br /> <br />
Each of the 3 has specific means of calculation and allocated percentages:
 <br /> <br />
- 30% of the funds for the social assistance scholarship are allocated first. This scholarship has the particularity that it only matters the personal need of the applicant, it does not matter the specialization from which he applies or how many scholarships were awarded for his specialization, if it falls as a priority to be offered a scholarship.
 <br /> <br />
-the scholarship of excellence (or performance) is given to students who have an average of 10 exclusively and extracurricular activities, based on which they obtain a score related to the file they submit. These scholarships are at the level of specialization.
 <br /> <br /> 
-the merit scholarship is obtained by students with very good results at school, with a minimum required average. This is granted from the remaining funds after the granting of the first types of scholarships. The number of scholarships awarded per specialization is directly proportional to the number of students. Also, the funds not distributed in a certain year of study of a specialization must be redistributed to the others of the respective specialization. If even then they are not exhausted, they will be redistributed to other specializations.
 <br /> <br /> <br />
Tasks
 <br /> <br />
Based on the information on how to award scholarships and a text file containing information about all students of the faculty, we must determine who will be the scholarship holders of the faculty. The total amount of scholarships and other useful information are provided in another text file. The display of the scholarship holders will be grouped according to the type of scholarship, cycle, specialization, year, ordered descending according to priority.
 <br /> <br />
I also developed a data generator to generate the required number of students, each with a unique GDPR code and logically linked information.
